In addition, the top comment of the week received fewer comments than others, like the third or fourth ones, for instance. It is easier to upvote a post than to write a comment, which requires knowledge/strong opinion on the matter. So what makes people upvote these titles? And what makes people in the third/fourth title write so many comments? Investigating this a little further revealed no surprise since they were responding to some of the week's top stories (according to the headlines in the paper, too), which affects people's savings and housing value. At least the top 5 titles, which I've checked manualy, deal with opinions about the Fed's new interest rate this week and housing prices.\n",
